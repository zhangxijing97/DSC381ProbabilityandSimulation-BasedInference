#  Explore the sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation
#  when the data come from an chi-squared distribution with df = 2
#  and the samples are of random samples of size 15.
#  Explore it by computing 10,000 values from this sampling distribution,
#  and then showing the histogram, the max, min, mean and standard deviation 
#  of this approximation of the sampling distribution.

#   First, let's just generate one value from this sampling distribution.
#   

y = rchisq(n=15,df=2,ncp=0)
y
value = sd(y)
value

#   Now, let's generate ten values from this sampling distribution
#   and list them, and find various summary statistics for this distribution.
#   Then see if these look like reasonable values for this sampling distn.

n = 15
m = 10

for (j in 1:m){
  
  y = rchisq(n=15,df=2,ncp=0)
  
  value[j] = sd(y)}

value
hist(value)
min(value)
max(value)
mean(value)
sd(value)


#  But, of course, just ten values from a sampling distribution is not
#  giving a good approximation of the distribution.   
#  Generate a larger number of them, like 1000,
#  and, of course, don't list them, by "commenting out" the command that lists.
