# DSC381ProbabilityandSimulation-BasedInference

## Confidence Interval

1. In Statistic, parameters of the population are often estimated based on the sample
2. Don’t know entire population -> draw a sample -> estimate parameters of the population
- parameters of the population: mean, variance and so on

### Example:
1. Want to know height of soccer player in USA.
2. Draw a sample, mean of the sample is most likely different from that of the population.
3. Draw several samples, each sampling is likely to come out with a difference mean.
4. Try to find a range in which the true value will lie with a high probability.
- High probability: 99%, 95%…
