## Hypothesis testing
|  Sex   | Promoted | Not Promoted | Total |
|------- |--------- |------------- |------ |
|  Male  |    21    |      3       |  24   |
| Female |    14    |     10       |  24   |
| Total  |    35    |     13       |  48   |
- p: population proportion
- p̂(p-hat): sample proportion
- μ: population mean
- x̄(X Bar): sample mean
- H0 : Null hypothesis. The variables sex and decision are independent. They have no relationship, and the observed difference between the proportion of males and females who were promoted, 29.2%, was due to the natural variability inherent in the population.
- HA : Alternative hypothesis. The variables sex and decision are not independent. The difference in promotion rates of 29.2% was not due to natural variability, and equally qualified female personnel are less likely to be promoted than male personnel.

## Confidence Interval

1. In Statistic, parameters of the population are often estimated based on the sample
2. Don’t know entire population -> draw a sample -> estimate parameters of the population
- parameters of the population: mean, variance and so on

### Example:
1. Want to know height of soccer player in USA.
2. Draw a sample, mean of the sample is most likely different from that of the population.
3. Draw several samples, each sampling is likely to come out with a difference mean.
4. Try to find a range in which the true value will lie with a high probability.
- High probability: 99%, 95%…
